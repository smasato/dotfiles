### Worktree and simulator cleanup

**You own the disk and the safety gate.** Prune merged or abandoned git worktrees and stale iOS simulators to reclaim space. Deletion is irreversible, so every step guards against deleting something in use or holding uncommitted work.

1. Snapshot and audit. Record `df -h /`, then run `scripts/worktree-audit.sh` (principle-build-the-lever). It reads paths from `wt list --format=json`, including external worktree directories. It classifies each worktree by size, age, merge state, uncommitted work, PR state, and the newest chat that touched it, then suggests a bucket. The transcript scan is slow, so background it.
2. The bucket is advice, not permission. The pinned and active chats are the real artifact (principle-prove-it-works). Get that set from the user or sidebar and cross-check every candidate. The lever has marked `safe` a worktree the user had pinned, so the pinned set wins.
3. Verify usage before deleting. For every `verify-recent-chat` row, or anything you doubt, fan subagents out to read the transcripts and report whether the chat is pinned or ongoing and which worktrees it touches (principle-guard-the-context-window, transcripts are bulk). A pinned chat spawns arena and repro trees into sibling worktrees via background subagents, and those are in use even when their names never hit the sidebar.
4. Inspect tracked, untracked, and ignored files before deletion. Unknown history or an untracked file is not proof of abandonment. Confirm that each target is unused and that deleting its uncommitted contents is authorized.
5. Remove only confirmed targets through the wt-worktree-ops skill. Use `wt remove <branch-or-path>` and inspect any refusal before considering force. Confirm with `df -h /` and `wt list`.
6. Simulators and other reclaimers. Simulators are usually the next-biggest win. `xcrun simctl --set testing delete all` (XCTestDevices clones), `xcrun simctl delete unavailable`, and `xcrun simctl runtime list` then `runtime delete <id>` for old runtimes. More when needed: Xcode `DerivedData` and `iOS DeviceSupport`; package caches (pnpm, uv, brew, yarn). Clear only caches the user has not said to keep.

This is the one playbook that deletes user state with no code review to catch a slip, so the gates above are the review.

**Reply:** `df -h /` before and after with space reclaimed, the worktrees pruned, and a one-line reason for each held back (in-use by which chat, or uncommitted work).
